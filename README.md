# react_clock

This is a mini project to demonstrate the purpose of state in React. 

It is a single clock at first and at the click of a button more an more clocks appear, each one with its own state. The number of clocks is held by the state of the parent of these clocks.

This was done in no small part with the help of React's documentation on State and Lifecycle:
