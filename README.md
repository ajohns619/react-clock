# react_clock

This is a mini project to demonstrate the purpose of state in React. 

It is a single clock at first and at the click of a button more and more clocks appear, each sharing one state which lives in the overarching Page class. The number of clocks is also held in the state of that parent.

The Babel transformer might misbehave in Chrome because of CORS restrictions, so if that doesn't work try another webbrowser, like FireFox.

This was done in no small part with the help of React's documentation on State and Lifecycle:
